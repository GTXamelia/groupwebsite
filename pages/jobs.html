	<h1>"Valve Time"</h1>
	<p>"Valve Time" is an industry term used jokingly with game releases from Valve, used to acknowledge the difference between the "promised" date for released content stated by Valve and to the "actual" release date; "Valve Time" includes predominant delays but also includes some content that was released earlier than expected. Valve itself has fully acknowledged the term, including tracking known discrepancies between ideal and actual releases on their public development wiki and using it in announcements about such delays. Valve ascribes delays to their mentality of team-driven initiatives over corporate deadlines to make sure they provide a high-quality product to their customers.</p>
	<p>Valve's former business development chief Jason Holtman stated that the company sees themselves as an "oddity" in an industry that looks towards punctual delivery of products; instead, Valve "[tries] as hard as we can to make the best thing possible in the right time frame and get people content they want to consume. And if that takes longer, that's fine". For that, Valve takes the concept of "Valve Time" as a compliment, and that "having customers consistently looking at our property or something you've done and saying, can you give me more" is evidence that they are making the right decisions with their game releases, according to Holtman. The company does try to avoid unintentional delays of their projects, and believes that the earlier occurrences of "Valve Time" delays, primarily from Half-Life development, has helped them improve their release schedules.</p>

	<h1>Our handbook for new employees</h1>
	<p>Congratulations, and welcome. We want to make sure that your first experiences in our unique culture are easy to navigate—working without bosses, no one telling you what to work on next, what’s the deal with the weekly massages, why do all the desks have wheels? What happens after you get here is something we spend a lot of time thinking about, so we’ve created a handbook for new employees that explains how we’re organized (or not!), why we’re set up that way, and what to expect the first day, first month, and first six months.</p>
	<p>View a pdf of the handbook in browser:</p>
