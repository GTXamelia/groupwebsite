<h1 class="titleslide">History</h1>
	<div class="box1">
	<h1>Founding and incorporation</h1>
	<p>Valve was founded by former longtime Microsoft employees Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington on August 24, 1996, as Valve L.L.C., based in Kirkland, Washington on the Seattle Eastside. After incorporation in April 2003, it moved from its original location to Bellevue, Washington, the same city in which their original publisher, Sierra On-Line, Inc., was based.</p>
	</div>
<div style="height: 20px"></div>
	<div class="box1">
	<h1>Half-Life</h1>
	<p>After securing a license to the Quake engine through the help of friend Michael Abrash of id Software in late 1996, Newell and Harrington began working on Half-Life. Originally planned for release in late 1997, Half-Life launched on November 19, 1998. Valve acquired TF Software PTY Ltd, the makers of the Team Fortress mod for Quake, in May 1998 with the intent to create a standalone Team Fortress game. The Team Fortress Classic mod, essentially a port of the original Team Fortress mod for Quake, was released for Half-Life in 1999. Gearbox contributed much after the release of Half-Life. Gearbox Software is responsible for the Half-Life expansion packs, Half-Life: Opposing Force and Half-Life: Blue Shift, along with the home console versions of Half-Life for the Sega Dreamcast and Sony PlayStation 2 which included a third expansion pack called Half-Life: Decay, that enabled two-player split-screen co-op.</p>

<div style="height: 20px"></div>
	<div class="box1">
	<h1>Acquisitions and awards</h1>
	<p>Valve has grown both in scope and commercial value. On January 10, 2008, Valve announced the acquisition of Turtle Rock Studios. On April 8, 2010, Valve won The Escapist Magazine's March Mayhem tournament for the best developer of 2010, beating out Zynga in the semi-finals and BioWare in the final.</p>
	<p>In 2012, the company acquired Star Filled Studios, a two-man gaming company to open a San Francisco office. In August 2013, however, Valve ended the operation when it was decided that there was little benefit coming from the arrangement.</p>

<div style="height: 20px"></div>
	
<h1 class="titleslide">Other ongoing projects</h1>
	<div class="box1">
	<h1>Steam</h1>
	<p>Valve announced its games platform Steam in 2002. At the time it looked merely to be a method of streamlining the patch process common in online video games, but was later revealed as a replacement for much of the framework of the World Opponent Network service and also as a distribution/digital rights management system for entire games.</p>
	<p>As of July 2014, there are over 3,400 games available on Steam, and in January 2014 Valve announced that it had surpassed 75 million active user accounts.</p>
	</div>
<div style="height: 20px"></div>
	<div class="box1">
	<h1>Steam Machine and VR Headset</h1>
	<p>Newell has been critical of the direction that Microsoft has taken with the Windows operating system in making it a closed architecture similar to Apple's products, and has stated that he believes that with changes made in Windows 8 are "a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space". Newell identified the open-source Linux platform as an ideal platform for Steam, noting that the only thing holding back its adoption is the lack of games.</p>
	<p>In 2012, Valve announced that they were working on a console/PC hybrid for the living room which was unofficially dubbed by media as the "Steam Box". A precursor to such a unit is SteamOS, a freely available Linux-based operating system that builds upon the Steam client functionality that includes media services, live streaming across home networks, game sharing within families, and parental controls. SteamOS was officially announced in September 2013 as the first of several announcements related to the Steam Machine platform as well as their unique game controller. In early Summer 2014, Valve announced that the company's own SteamOS-powered Steam Machine would be delayed until 2015 due to problems with the game controller.</p>
	<p>In March 2015, Valve and HTC announced a joint project to develop Vive, a head-mounted virtual reality display. The companies are working with Google, Lions Gate, and HBO to develop content for the device.

	<div class="box1">
	<h1>Pipeline</h1>
	<p>In July 2013, Valve officially announced Pipeline, an intern project consisting of ten high school students working together to learn how to create video game content. Pipeline serves a dual purpose:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>to discuss and answer questions that teenagers often ask about the video game industry. </li>
			<li>to see if it is possible to train a group of teenagers with minimal work experience to work for a company like Valve. </li>
		</ol>
